# OurNYC


#### Overview
OurNYC is an interactive website that maps information about NYC neighborhoods. The website displays a map of NYC with each neighborhood outlined. When you click on a polygon, a description of the neighborhood, a picture of part of the neighborhoods and it's ethnic demographics. The site also includes an autocomplete search which will pop up the neighborhood that you search up.

#### Inspiration
We built OurNYC with the intent to teach everyone about the history each neighborhood in the city because many of us, despite living in the city for many years, has no idea about the existence of other neighborhoods. We also wanted to show where each neighborhood is and the demographics.
In the future, we want to also display the socio-economic data and include the bus routes and subway routes that go through each neighborhood. Additionally, we want to include a Twitter and Instagram feed of people in the city.
